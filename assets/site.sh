I am a software engineer currently based at Dublin, Ireland.
 
Proud father, dog owner, husband and geek.
 
I’m currently working for http://zendesk.com on a telecom powered project using
Twilio with more than 20 million http requests and 5 million phone calls a week.
 
I’m really excited about backend and scalability.
