Structures (a.k.a. structs) are a very important concept of [Go](http://golang.org){:target="_blank"}. With them you can structure your data in memory.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Person struct {
	name string
	age  int
}

func main() {
	p := Person{
		name: "Alan",
		age:  25,
	}
	fmt.Printf("%v is %v years old\n", p.name, p.age) // result should be "Alan is 25 years old"
	p.name = "Bryan"
	fmt.Printf("%v is %v years old\n", p.name, p.age) // result should be "Bryan is 25 years old"
}
```

As you can see in `a := person{ ... }` we can initialize a struct with data. And update it later (`a.Name = "Bryan"`) at any time.
