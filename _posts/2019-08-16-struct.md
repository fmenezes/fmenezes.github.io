Structures (a.k.a. structs) are a very important concept of [Go](http://golang.org){:target="_blank"}. With them you can structure your data in memory.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type person struct {
	Name string
	Age  int
}

func main() {
	a := person{
		Name: "Alan",
		Age:  25,
	}
	fmt.Println(a.Name) // result should be "Alan"
	fmt.Println(a.Age)  // result should be 25
	a.Name = "Bryan"
	fmt.Println(a.Name) // result should be "Bryan"
}
```

As you can see in `a := person{ ... }` we can initialize a struct with data. And update it later (`a.Name = "Bryan"`) at any time.

Structs can also have methods.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type person struct {
	Name string
	Age  int
}

func (p *person) Print() {
	fmt.Printf("%v is %v years old\n", p.Name, p.Age)
}

func main() {
	a := person{
		Name: "Alan",
		Age:  25,
	}
	a.Print() // result should be "Alan is 25 years old"
	a.Name = "Bryan"
	a.Print() // result should be "Bryan is 25 years old"
}
```

Check `func (p *person) Print()` this contains what is called a *function receiver*.
